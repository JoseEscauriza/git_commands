# The `git branch` command

A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the **edit/stage/commit** process. 

You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.

The `git branch` command lets you **create, list, rename, and delete branches**. It doesnâ€™t let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again.

For this reason, `git branch` is tightly integrated with the `git switch` and `git merge` commands.
